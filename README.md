## Overview
WastelessHarvest is a revolutionary platform dedicated to reducing food waste by connecting food suppliers (e.g., restaurants, supermarkets, caterers) 
with individuals or organizations in need of food assistance.
The food waste management system connects food suppliers with nearby individuals or organizations in need of food. Food suppliers create listings for their excess food on
the platform, describing the type and quantity of food available, as well as the pickup location and time. Recipients  search for available listings on the platform and contact the food supplier directly to arrange for pickup. The system provides contact details for the supplier
